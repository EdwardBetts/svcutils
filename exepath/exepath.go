	// Since -fork reexecutes with the exepath.Abs path, this prevents paths like
	//   $BIN/../etc/foo.conf from working (where $BIN is the dir of the executable path).
	//
	// Okay, maybe this is a byzantine configuration. But still, this breaks my existing
	// configuration, so I'm sticking with os.Args[0] for now, as -fork should be as seamless
	// as possible to relying applications.
